Alright, this is the plan to create a poker game that is controlled by voice.

The game is played on smart TVs or Fire TVs. The app is launched on those devices and a QR code is displayed, which the user then uses with their mobile phone to create a connection.

There is already a mobile controller system at the company, and there is some documentation I have linked for you below.

Mobile Controller onboarding guide: https://www.notion.so/Mobile-Controller-On-Boarding-Guide-24e442bc9713806b9423c945d33aa31a?source=copy_link

The company's game framework repo can be found here: /Users/pratik/dev/vgf

There is also a voice recognition system at the company, the repo for which you can find in this folder: /Users/pratik/dev/recognition-service

My vision of the game is that the players can see their cards on their controller and there is some representation of the cards on screen. The players can play multiplayer with people in the same room, and there are also AI bots who are controlled by an LLM who can play against them.

The players use their voice to talk to the dealer to carry out the normal functions in the game.

We're going to stick with standard rules of poker, the most common, or at least the ones most commonly used in video games. Nothing too outlandish.

I want you to create a team to carry out some research on the rules of poker and how they can be applied. I also want your team members to go and create documentation for the mobile controller, the recognition service as well as the company's game framework.

Before you write the PRD, I want you to ask me questions to resolve any ambiguities.

We are going to use 3D, and this game is going to look like a console game.

The team members that you create should be a combination of product managers, game designers, art directors, as well as a technical director. Each team member has decades of experience in the games industry, having worked on mobile, desktop, and console games.

In terms of technology, let's go with theatrejs, And other web-based technologies. I also want you to research what skills you will need in order to write the PRD.

Once the PRD is complete, we need a team member who is a very experienced developer with 20 years of experience working in 3D and React to create the technical design document.

And then I want an experienced manager to create a development plan which can be carried out by the team. We also need an art director team member to come up with prompts that can be fed into MESHY.AI to generate the art assets that we need.
